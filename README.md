Operations Terminal

# OTerm gem

A VT100 terminal (mostly) server that can be placed in an application to allow
telnet access to exposed features. Some of the features includes are:

 - Line editing

 - VT100 support with graphics and color

 - Configurable help and command registration

 - Auto completion

 - History

The driver for writing this gem was to be able to control, inspect, and debug
multi-threaded applications while the application is running. Look for it's use
soon in the ODisk application and later in a more interesting project.
